Array-To-Moose version 0.0.5

Array::To::Moose builds Moose objects from suitably-sorted 2-dimensional
arrays of data, of the kind returned by routines like
DBI::fetchall_arrayref(), i.e. (a reference to) an array containing
references to an array for each row of data fetched.

It is particularly useful in building nested Moose objects from SQL queries
on tables which have nested one-to-many relationships with other tables.

The Moose objects must first be defined by the user.
