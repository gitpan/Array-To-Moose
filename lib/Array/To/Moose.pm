=head1 NAME

Array::To::Moose - Build Moose objects from a data array

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Array::To::Moose version 0.0.4

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Array::To::Moose;
  # or
  use Array::To::Moose qw(array_to_moose set_class_ind set_key_ind
                          throw_nonunique_keys throw_multiple_rows   );

C<Array::To::Moose> exports function C<array_to_moose()> by default, and
convenience functions C<set_class_ind()>, C<set_key_ind()>,
C<throw_nonunique_keys()> and C<throw_multiple_rows()> if requested.

=head2 array_to_moose

C<array_to_moose()> builds Moose objects from suitably-sorted
2-dimensional arrays of data of the type returned by, e.g.,
L<DBI::selectall_arrayref()|DBI/selectall_arrayref>
i.e.  a reference to an array containing
references to an array for each row of data fetched.

=head2 Example 1a

  package Car;
  use Moose;

  has 'make'  => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str');
  has 'model' => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str');
  has 'year'  => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Int');

  package CarOwner;
  use Moose;

  has 'last'  => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str');
  has 'first' => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str');
  has 'Cars'  => (is => 'ro', isa => ArrayRef[Car]');

  ...

  # in package main:

  use Array::To::Moose;

  # In this dataset Alex owns two cars, Jim one, and Alice three
  my $data = [
    [ qw( Green Alex  Ford   Focus 2011 ) ],
    [ qw( Green Alex  VW     Jetta 2009 ) ],
    [ qw( Green Jim   Honda  Civic 2007 ) ],
    [ qw( Smith Alice Buick  Regal 2012 ) ],
    [ qw( Smith Alice Toyota Camry 2008 ) ],
    [ qw( Smith Alice BMW    X5    2010 ) ],
  ];

  my $CarOwners = array_to_moose(
                      data => $data,
                      desc => {
                        class => 'CarOwner',
                        last  => 0,
                        first => 1,
                        Cars  => {
                          class => 'Car',
                          make  => 2,
                          model => 3,
                          year  => 4,
                        } # Cars
                      } # Car Owners
  );

  print $CarOwners->[2]->Cars->[1]->model; # prints "Camry"

=head2 Example 1b - Hash(ref) Sub-objects

In the above example, C<array_to_moose()> returns a reference to an
B<array> of C<CarOwner> objects, C<$CarOwners>.

If a B<hash> of C<CarOwner> objects is required, a "C<key =E<gt>>... " entry
must be added to the descriptor hash. For example, to construct a hash of
C<CarOwner> objects, whose key is the owner's first name, (unique for
every person in the example data), the call
becomes:

  my $CarOwnersH = array_to_moose(
                      data => $data,
                      desc => {
                        class => 'CarOwner',
                        key   => 1,   # note key
                        last  => 0,
                        first => 1,
                        Cars  => {
                          class => 'Car',
                          make  => 2,
                          model => 3,
                          year  => 4,
                        } # Cars
                      } # Car Owners
  );

  print $CarOwnersH->{Alex}->Cars->[0]->make; # prints "Ford"

Similarly, to construct the C<Cars> sub-objects as I<hash> sub-objects
(and not an I<array> as above), define C<CarOwner> as:

  package CarOwner;
  use Moose;

  has 'last'  => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str'         );
  has 'first' => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str'         );
  has 'Cars'  => (is => 'ro', isa => 'HashRef[Car]'); # Was 'ArrayRef[Car]'

and noting that the car C<make> is unique for each person in the C<$data> dataset, we
construct the reference to an array of objects with the call:

  $CarOwners = array_to_moose(
                      data => $data,
                      desc => {
                        class => 'CarOwner',
                        last  => 0,
                        first => 1,
                        Cars  => {
                          class => 'Car',
                          key   => 2,   # note key
                          model => 3,
                          year  => 4,
                        } # Cars
                      } # Car Owners
  );

  print $CarOwners->[2]->Cars->{BMW}->model; # prints 'X5'

=head2 Example 1c - "Simple" Reference Attributes

If, instead of the car owner object containing an ArrayRef or HashRef of
C<Car> sub-objects, it contains, say, a ArrayRef of strings representing the
names of the car makers:

  package SimpleCarOwner;
  use Moose;

  has 'last'      => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str'          );
  has 'first'     => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str'          );
  has 'CarMakers' => (is => 'ro', isa => 'ArrayRef[Str]');

Using the same dataset from Example 1a, we construct an arrayref
C<SimpleCarOwner> objects as:

  $SimpleCarOwners = array_to_moose(
                        data => $data,
                        desc => {
                          class     => 'SimpleCarOwner',
                          last      => 0,
                          first     => 1,
                          CarMakers => [2],  # Note the '[...]' brackets
                        }
  );

  print $SimpleCarOwners->[2]->[1];   # prints 'Toyota'

I.e., when the object attribute is an I<ArrayRef> of one of the Moose "simple" types,
e.g. C<'Str'>, C<'Num'>, C<'Bool'>,
etc (See L<Moose::Manual::Types|THE TYPES>), then the column number should
appear in square brackets ('C<CarMakers =E<gt> [2]>' above) to differentiate them from the bare
types (C<last =E<gt> 0,> and C<first =E<gt> 1,> above).

Note that Array::To::Moose doesn't (yet) handle the case of hashrefs of
"simple" types, e.g., C<( isa =E<gt> "HashRef[Str]" )>

=head2 Example 2 - Use with DBI

The main rationale for writing C<Array::To::Moose> is to make it easy to build
Moose objects from data extracted from relational databases,
especially when the database query
involves multiple tables with one-to-many relationships to each other.

As an example, consider a database which models patients making visits
to a clinic on multiple occasions, and on each visit, having a doctor
run some tests and diagnose the patient's complaint. In this model, the
database I<Patient> table would have a one-to-many relationship with the
I<Visit> table, which in turn would have a one-to-many relationship with
the I<Test> table

The corresponding Moose model has nested Moose objects which reflects those
one-to-many relationships, i.e.,
multiple Visit objects per Patient object and multiple Test objects
per Visit object, declared as:

  package Test;
  use Moose;
  has 'name'        => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str');
  has 'result'      => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str');

  package Visit;
  use Moose;
  has 'date'        => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str'           );
  has 'md'          => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str'           );
  has 'diagnosis'   => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str'           );
  has 'Tests'       => (is => 'rw', isa => 'HashRef[Test]' );

  package Patient;
  use Moose;
  has 'last'        => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str'             );
  has 'first'       => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str'             );
  has 'Visits'      => (is => 'rw', isa => 'ArrayRef[Visit]' );

In the main program:

  use DBI;
  use Array::To::Moose;

  ...

  my $sql = q{
    SELECT
       P.Last, P.First
      ,V.Date, V.Doctor, V.Diagnosis
      ,T.Name, T.Result
    FROM
       Patient P
      ,Visit   V
      ,Test    T
    WHERE
          -- join clauses
          P.Patient_key = V.Patient_key
      AND V.Visit_key   = T.Visit_key
      ...
    ORDER BY
        P.Last, P.First, V.Date
  };

  my $dbh = DBI->connect(...);

  my $data = $dbh->selectall_arrayref($sql);

  # rows of @$data contain:
  #               Last, First, Date, Doctor, Diagnosis, Name, Result
  # at positions: [0]   [1]    [2]   [3]     [4]        [5]   [6]

  my $patients = array_to_moose(
                      data => $data,
                      desc => {
                        class => 'Patient',
                        last  => 0,
                        first => 1,
                        Visits => {
                          class => 'Visit',
                          date      => 2,
                          md        => 3,
                          diagnosis => 4,
                          Tests => {
                            class  => 'Test',
                            key    => 5,
                            name   => 5,
                            result => 6,
                          } # tests
                        } # visits
                      } # patients
  );

  print $patients->[2]->Visits->[0]->Tests->{BP}->result; # prints '120/80'

Note: We used the Test C<name> as the key for the Visit 'C<Tests>', as the
tests have unique names within any one Visit.
(See t/5.t)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

As shown in the above examples, the general usage is:

  package MyClass;
  use Moose;
  (define Moose object(s))
  ...
  use Array::To::Moose;
  ...
  my $data_ref = selectall_arrayref($sql); # for example

  my $object_ref =  array_to_moose(
                        data => $data_ref
                        desc => {
                          class    => 'MyClass',
                          key      => K,   # only for HashRefs
                          attrib_1 => N1,
                          attrib_2 => N2,
                          ...
                          attrib_m => [ M ],
                          ...
                          SubObject => {
                            class => 'MySubClass',
                            ...
                          }
                        }
  );

Where:

C<array_to_moose()> returns an array- or hash reference of C<MyClass>
Moose objects.
All Moose classes (C<MyClass>, C<MySubClass>, etc) must
already have been defined by the user.

C<$data_ref> is a reference to an array containing references to arrays of
scalars of the kind returned by, e.g.,
L<DBI::selectall_arrayref()|DBI/selectall_arrayref>

C<desc> (descriptor) is a reference to a hash which contains several types
of data:

C<class =E<gt>> 'MyObj' is I<required> and defines the Moose class or
package which will contain the data. The user should have defined this class
already.

C<key =E<gt> N > is required
if the Moose object being constructed is to be a hashref, either at
the top-level Moose object returned from C<array_to_moose()> or as a
"C<isa =E<gt> 'HashRef[...]'>" sub-object.

C<attrib =E<gt> N > where C<attrib> is the name of a Moose attribute
("C<has 'attrib' =E<gt>> ...") 

C<attrib =E<gt> [ N ] > where C<attrib> is the name of a Moose "simple" sub-attribute
("C<has =E<gt> 'attrib' ( isa =E<gt> 'ArrayRef[Type]' ...)> "), where C<Type>
is a "simple" Moose type, e.g., C<'Str', 'Int'>, etc.

In the above cases, C<N> is a positive integer containing the
the corresponding zero-indexed
column number in the data array where that attribute's data is to be found.

=head2 Sub-Objects

C<array_to_moose()> can handle three types of Moose sub-objects, i.e.:

an array of sub-objects:

  has => 'Sub_Obj' ( isa => 'ArrayRef[MyObj]' );

a hash of sub-objects:

  has => 'Sub_Obj' ( isa => 'HashRef[MyObj]'  );

or a single sub-object:

  has => 'Sub_Obj' ( isa => 'MyObj'           );

the descriptor entry for C<Sub_Obj> in each of these cases is (almost) the same:

  desc => {
    class => ...
    ...
    Sub_Obj => {
      class    => 'MyObj',
      key      => <keycol> # HashRef['] only
      attrib_a => <N>,
      ...
    } # end SubObj
    ...
  } # end desc

(A C<HashRef[']> sub-object will also I<require> a
C<key =E<gt> N> entry in the descriptor).

In addition, C<array_to_moose()> can also handle C<ArrayRef>s of "simple"
types:

  has => 'Sub_Obj' ( isa => 'ArrayRef[Type]' );

where C<Type> is a "simple" Moose type, e.g., C<'Str', 'Int, 'Bool'>, etc.

=head2 Ordering the data

C<array_to_moose()> does not sort the input data array, and does all
processing in a single pass through the data. This means that the data in the
array must be sorted properly for the algorithm to work.

For example, in the previous Patient/Visit/Test example, in which there are
many I<Test>s per I<Visit> and many I<Visit>s per I<Patient>, the data in the
I<Test> column(s) must change the fastest, the I<Visit> data slower, and the
I<Patient> data the slowest:

  Patient  Visit  Test
  ------   -----  ----
    P1      V1     T1
    P1      V1     T2
    P1      V1     T3
    P1      V2     T4
    P1      V2     T5
    P2      V3     T6
    P2      V3     T7
    P2      V4     T8

In SQL this would be accomplished by a C<SORT BY> clause, e.g.:

  SORT BY Patient.Key, Visit.Key, Test.Key

=head2 throw_nonunique_keys ()

By default, C<array_to_moose()> does not check the uniqueness of hash key
values within the data. If the key values in the data are not unique,
existing hash entries will get overwritten, and
the sub-object will contain the value from the last data row which
contained that key value. For example:

  package Employer;
  use Moose;
  has 'year'    => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str');
  has 'name'    => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str');

  package Person;
  use Moose;
  has 'name'        => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str'              );
  has 'Employers'   => (is => 'rw', isa => 'HashRef[Employer]');

  ...

  my $data = [
    [ 'Anne Miller', '2005', 'Acme Corp'    ],
    [ 'Anne Miller', '2006', 'Acme Corp'    ],
    [ 'Anne Miller', '2007', 'Widgets, Inc' ],
    ...
  ];

The call:

  my $obj = array_to_moose(
                  data => $data,
                  desc => {
                    class     => 'Person',
                    name      => 0,
                    Employers => {
                      class => 'Employer',
                      key   => 2,   # using employer name as key
                      year  => 1,
                    } # Employer
                  } # Person
  );

Because the employer was C<'Acme Corp'> in years 2005 & 2006,
C<array_to_moose>
will silently overwrite the 2005 Employer object with the data for the
2006 Employer object:

  print $obj->[0]->Employers->{'Acme Corp'}->year, "\n"; # prints '2006'

Calling C<throw_uniq_keys()> (either with no argument, or with a non-zero
argument) enables reporting of non-unique keys. In the above example,
C<array_to_moose()> would exit with warning:

 Non-unique key 'Acme Corp' in 'Employer' class ...

Calling C<throw_uniq_keys(0)>, i.e. with an argument of zero will disable
subsequent reporting of non-unique keys.
(See t/8c.t)

=head2 throw_multiple_rows ()

For single-occurence sub-objects (i.e. C<( isa =E<gt> 'MyObj' )>),
if the data contains more than one row of data for the sub-object,
only the first row will be used to construct the single sub-object and
C<array_to_moose()> will not report the fact. E.g.:

  package Salary;
  use Moose;
  has 'year'    => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str');
  has 'amount'  => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');

  package Person;
  use Moose;
  has 'name'     => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Str'   );
  has 'Salary'   => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Salary'); # a single object

  ...

  my $data = [
    [ 'John Smith', '2005', 23_350 ],
    [ 'John Smith', '2006', 24_000 ],
    [ 'John Smith', '2007', 26_830 ],
    ...
  ];

The call:

  my $obj = array_to_moose(
                  data => $data,
                  desc => {
                    class  => 'Person'
                    name   => 0,
                    Salary => {
                      class  => 'Salary',
                      year   => 1,
                      amount => 2
                    } # Salary
                  } # Person
  );

would silently assign to C<Salary>, the first row of the three Salary
data rows, i.e. for year 2005:

  print $object->[0]->Salary->year, "\n"; # prints '2005'

Calling C<throw_multiple_rows()>
(either with no argument, or with a non-zero argument)
enables reporting of this situation. In the
above example, C<array_to_moose()> will exit with error:

  Expected a single 'Salary' object, but got 3 of them ...

Calling C<throw_multiple_rows(0)>, i.e. with an argument of zero will disable
subsequent reporting of this error.
(See t/8d.t)

=head2 set_class_ind (), set_key_ind ()

Problems arise if the Moose objects being constructed contain attributes
called I<class> or I<key>, causing ambiguities in the descriptor. (Does
C<key =E<gt> 5> mean the I<attribute> C<key> or the I<hash key> C<key> is in
the 5th column?)

In these cases, C<set_class_ind()> and
C<set_key_ind()> can be used to change the keywords for C<class
=E<gt> ...> and C<key =E<gt> ...> descriptor entries.

For example:

  package Letter;
  use Moose;

  has 'address' => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Str'         );
  has 'class'   => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'PostalClass' );
  ...

  set_key_ind('package'); # use "package =>" in place of "class =>"

  my $letters = array_to_moose(
                        data => $data,
                        desc => {
                          package => 'Letter',  # the Moose class
                          address => 0,
                          class   => 1,         # the attribute 'class'
                          ...
                        }
  );


=head2 Read-only Attributes

One of the recommendations of L<Moose::Manual::BestPractices>
is to make attributes read-only (C<isa =E<gt> 'ro'>) wherever
possible. C<Array::To::Moose> supports this by evaluating all the
attributes for a given object given in the descriptor, then including
them all in the call to C<new(...)> when constructing the object.

For Moose objects with attributes which are
sub-objects, i.e.  references to a Moose object, or references to an array or hash of
Moose objects, it means that the sub-objects must be evaluated before the
C<new()> call. The effect of this for multi-leveled Moose objects is that
object evaluations are carried out depth-first.

=head2 Treatment of C<NULL>s

C<array_to_moose()> uses
L<Array::GroupBy::igroup_by|Array::GroupBy.pm/DESCRIPTION>
to compare the rows in
the data given in C<data =E<gt> ...>, using function
L<Array::GroupBy::str_row_equal()|Array::GroupBy.pm/Routines_str_row_equal()_and_num_row_equal()>
which compares the data as I<strings>.

If the data contains C<undef> values, typically returned from
database SQL queries in which L<DBI> maps NULL values to C<undef>, when
C<str_row_equal()> encounters C<undef> elements in I<corresponding> column
positions, it will consider the elements C<equal>.  When I<corresponding>
column elements are defined and C<undef> respectively, the elements are
considered C<unequal>.

This truth table demonstrates the various combinations:

  -------+------------+--------------+--------------+--------------
  row 1  | ('a', 'b') | ('a', undef) | ('a', undef) | ('a', 'b'  )
  row 2  | ('a', 'b') | ('a', undef) | ('a', 'b'  ) | ('a', undef)
  -------+------------+--------------+--------------+--------------
  equal? |    yes     |     yes      |      no      |      no

=head1 EXPORT

C<array_to_moose> by default; C<throw_nonunique_keys>, C<throw_multiple_rows>,
C<set_class_ind> and C<set_key_ind> if requested.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Errors in the call of C<array-to-moose()> will be caught by
L<Params::Validate::Array>, q.v.

<array-to-moose> does a lot of error checking, and is probably annoyingly
chatty. Most of the errors generated are, of course, self-explanatory :-)
